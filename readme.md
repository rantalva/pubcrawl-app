# Pubcrawl app
## Gather your friends, use your location and select amount of bars you and your friends want to crawl.
### This app was inspired by [Kallion kapakkageneraattori](https://kallioon.fi/)
### Idea of the app:

App uses your current location and uses a radius of minumum 500 meters to maximum of 3 kilometers to fetch bars and pubs inside that radius. You can then select the amount of bars from 3 to 10 to be selected randomly from found bars inside the radius.

## Used technologies:
### APIs:
[Geoapify Places API](https://www.geoapify.com/places-api/) This is used to fetch the bars and pubs.

[Geoapify Routing API](https://www.geoapify.com/routing-api/) This is used for generating the route from bars to other one.
